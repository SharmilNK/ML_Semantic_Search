Getting predictions from the tree

We continue splitting the tree either until we cannot split any further, or we decide to stop
The bottom nodes are called “leaves” of the tree
If a leaf has >1 examples at it, we take the majority class and label all examples at the leaf with that class prediction

(3,1)

(1,3)

Prediction: ”Class A”

(A,B)
